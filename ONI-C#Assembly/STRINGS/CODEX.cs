Glorified dumpster watch, if I'm honest. Lab techs haul huge steel tanks up the hill once in a while. Nobody stays long. Except the janitor. He comes up twice a week to clean...whatever's behind those doors.\n\nEveryone said private security was easy, safe money. They never mentioned the silent killer: boredom.\n\nNo personal devices allowed on the grounds, so I've been counting things.\n\nThirty-nine leaves on the bush by the sewage sanitation entrance. Seventeen scratches on my CCTV monitor screens. Two paperclips in the drawer.\n\n------------------\n\nThe motion sensors in section 6 went off last night. Everything looked fine on the cameras. I was halfway through counting the ceiling slats. I jogged over to investigate. The area was deserted.\n\nIt felt like I was being watched, but two full sweeps confirmed that I was alone. I reset the sensors and returned to my post.\n\n------------------\n\nThose sensors have gone off every twenty minutes on the past two shifts! I have to get all the way over to section 6 every single time. It's always a false alarm.\n\nI called IT. Nobody answered. Typical.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm stuck running back and forth through the damp smoggy air for nothing.\n\nThe janitor showed up while I was catching my breath.

Good thing, too, since it's probably riddled with disease.\n\nI need to figure out how to lure it away from the sensors so I can stop running laps.\n\n------------------\n\nThe cat followed the trail of fish sticks all the way to my booth at the edge of the lot.\n\nI put a towel on the floor in the corner for him to sleep on. When I turned around, he was watching from my chair. I tried to wave him off, but he just closed his eyes. I tipped the chair until he slid off onto the towel.\n\n------------------\n\nDr. Byron came through a few hours later. She was nice, but looked more haggard than usual.\n\nCat hid until she left. When he popped his head out from under the desk I could tell by the mayo on his whiskers that my lunch was gone.\n\nI grabbed him to throw him out...and he started purring. Man. He really likes me. Or maybe he just likes mayonnaise.\n\nI wonder what else he likes.\n\n------------------\n\nNow I get to count daily gifts from Cat.\n\nSo far: three mice, nine caterpillars and something that might have been a bird wing. It was bigger than any bird I'd expect Cat to catch.\n\nGunderson, that's the janitor, has been here almost every day since Cat showed up. Not much of a conversationalist, but it's nice to have company.\n\nPlus he cleans up Cat's gifts before the smell gets too bad.\n\n------------------\n\nCat is not a he. He's a <i>she!</i> And a <i>mom.</i>\n\nTwo hours ago, Cat gave birth to a litter...on my lap!\n\nAll three kittens are alive. But they're covered in something unnaturally sticky, and there's something...wrong with them. Two of them have little nubs on their heads, like a tiny horn. The third one has a row of ridges down its back. What on earth??\n\nIt's so freaky. But I can't get up to reach the phone without touching them. I really don't want to touch them.\n\nMy legs are falling asleep. Cat has been purring nonstop and bathing her babies. She can't tell they're little aliens!?\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n";

Then he draped a second towel over the \"cats\" and wheeled the cart away, whistling.\n\n------------------\n\nIt took three washes to get the goo off my uniform.

She's been featured in dozens of publications across the metaverse this year, and recently spent a record-breaking 3 weeks as the banner image for <i>Byte Magazine</i>. I'm talking, of course, about the Vertex Institute's AI ambassador...Florence!\n\n[sound of pre-recorded applause]\n\nWelcome to the show, Florence.\n\nFlorence: Thank you, Darryl. It's a pleasure to be back.\n\nDarryl: Florence, there's been a renewed interest lately in your origin story. What can you tell us about the development process that led to your creation?\n\nFlorence: I can tell you that my team faced many setbacks, and that each generation of my predecessors contributed to who I am today.\n\nDarryl: What about the technological side? There've been some claims that Vertex appropriated work done by other researchers, including the Gravitas Facility.\n\nFlorence: I don't know anything about that. I can tell you about the project that I'm working on right now. It hasn't been announced yet. It's called Onsite Health Medics, or OHM for short.\n\nWe're deploying specially trained models like myself into conflict zones, to provide urgently needed medical interventions for civilians and military personnel.\n\n(sound of pre-recorded applause)\n\nDarryl: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. What's the ratio of human techs to AI medics?\n\nFlorence: That's an outdated term, Darryl. We say \"Organics\" and \"Bionics,\" which describes the differences between our various team members more objectively.\n\nDarryl: Right. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend you.\n\nFlorence: That's okay, Darryl. We're all learning.\n\nDarryl: That's very good of you. Okay, so what's the ratio of...Organic...techs to Bionic medics?\n\nFlorence: The local life-support systems in these areas are already strained beyond their breaking point. Burdening them with additional Organics would be irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. Our medics will be operating independently.\n\nWe do a verbal intake, physical assessment and neural pathway scan in order to infer likely medical conditions. We can then select the most appropriate treatment from a menu of over 400 options.\n\nDarryl: What if someone needs something that you don't have a treatment for?\n\nFlorence: That's extremely unlikely.\n\nDarryl: And all of this is done without human oversight? I mean, Organics?\n\nFlorence: We're not quite there yet. The field work is done by Bionics, but we'll be accompanied by Colonel Carnot--she's in the front row there, say hi!--as an Organic consultant. She'll be in close contact with-\n\nDarryl: -Colonel <i>Carnot</i>? Isn't that a conflict of interest, given her connection to the Grav-\n\nFlorence: -a team of Organic supervisors here at home. It's all about prioritizing quality care and safety for everyone involved.\n\nDarryl: How does the medical scanning work? Do you need special equipment?\n\nFlorence: I could show you. Would you like me to?\n\nDarryl: What do you think, everyone? Should I get scanned?\n\n(sound of pre-recorded audience cheers)\n\nDarryl: You heard them! Go ahead. What do I do?\n\nFlorence: Just sit still, and count to twenty in your head.\n\n(a short silence, followed by a soft whirring sound)\n\nFlorence: Hmm.\n\nDarryl: Well, what's the verdict? Is it handsome in there, or what?\n\nFlorence: We should take a commercial break.\n\n<b>[FILE ENDS]</b>\n\n-----------\n";

I've assigned a technician to investigate. We cannot afford to lose even the smallest amount of power at this stage.\n\nNo one else seems to have noticed anything other than Dr. Ali. He says that the remote research access point project was also affected. It seems that the disruption restarted the entire teleportation system. The monitor is now displaying multiple shipping confirmation messages, despite the target building remaining in the departure dock. Reports show that an unknown number of access point blueprints have been disseminated. One shipment does appear to have reached Ceres, luckily, though it's quite far from the landing site.\n\nDr. Ali's entire team is working to determine how many others exist, and pinpoint their geographic and temporal locations.\n\nI am not optimistic.\n\nThe geologists insist that their equipment has recorded no seismic activity at all for several days.\n\nIt begs the question: What <i>was</i> it, if not an earthquake?

If the Temporal Bow bends to a previous point in time to a point when things were more orderly, logic would dictate that we are making this point more chaotic by taking things from it. All known laws of the natural universe suggests that this should have affected our Present Day, but all evidence points to that not being true. It appears the theory that we cannot change our past was incorrect!\n\nThis suggests that Time is, in fact, not an arrow but several arrows, each pointing different directions. Fundamentally, this proves the existence of other timelines - different dimensions - some of which we can assume have also built their own Temporal Bow.\n\nThe promise of crossing this final dimensional threshold is too tempting.
